# Label Pipeline

This repository hosts the necessary AWS Lambda scripts to facilitate audio labeling pipeline. There are three main components to the pipeline: [Audio Transcription using AWS Transcribe](https://github.com/bookbot-kids/label-pipeline/tree/main/src/transcribe), [Label Studio Webhook Integration](https://github.com/bookbot-kids/label-pipeline/tree/main/src/webhook_listener), and [Audio Splitting](https://github.com/bookbot-kids/label-pipeline/tree/main/src/audio_splitter).
